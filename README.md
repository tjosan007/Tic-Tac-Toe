# Tic-Tac-Toe
An awesome Tic-Tac-Toe app coded in Swift

This app was my first real attempt at creating a robust application in Swift using the Xcode IDE.
The designs are initially created in Sketch 3, and later the designs are implemented into the actual program.

Tic-Tac-Toe is a good beginner project because it encompasses a lot of material learned into one app, while not overcomplicating the application. With this app concept it is easier to get familiar with the Sketch 3 interface for designing future applications.
